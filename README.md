# fluffy-telegram/Challenge-01

## Description

This project was undertaken to conform a client's website to current accessability standards. This project also aimed to consolidate and 'clean-up' some of the original code. This allows other developers to build on the current code, should it be required. I learned that there are many ways to simplify code, especially css class elements in order to apply to many different parts of a site that are formatted in the same fashion.
 
## Usage

This site can be used like any other, below you will find a screenshot of the current deployment of the site:
